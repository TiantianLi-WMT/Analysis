# Top Market Analysis

## How do we select Top Market?
We find all essential information about each store, including:
1. current capacity (MPC) and demand _(pending to get current demand from Weifang)_
2. FY24, FY26, and FY29 forecast demand (compare ubber bound rebaseline and one demand forecast) _(pending to compare results from one demand fcst, team having an updated version by end of week)_
3. future capacity under PU2.0 remode schedule (future MPC post FY25 remodel)
4. future capacity under PU2.0 and approved or recommended MFC _(do we look at approved only or include recommended from AOP submission?)_
5. UPLH average in past 12 weeks (for available ones only from Gunish)
6. order basket and size for OPD and unscheduled in past 3 months _(check definition of OPD and unscheduled)_
7. Unscheduled (DFS/SFS/FC-LMD) actuals _check results and compare with 6_

Once store level information is collected, we aggregate the results into each market based on the new market definition which generate a list of 2k non overlapping markets:
1. FY24 utilization
2. FY26 utilization with PU2.0
3. FY26 utilization with PU2.0 and MFC
4. FY29 utilization with PU2.0
5. FY29 utilization with PU2.0 and MFC
6. UPLH avg
7. Order basket and size
8. Unscheduled orders demand

Then assess for each BU:
1. What's the percentile for each metric, market demand, store demand _(within market or BU?)_, FY26 utilization
2. How many markets / stores within a BU currently exceed MPC
